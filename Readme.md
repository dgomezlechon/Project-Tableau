# Visualization Project

## Introduction

In this project I'm going to analyze the company of Apple, looking at price evolution as well as fundamental historical data. In order to do so I will use the data from my previous ETL project and make the history Dashboards using Tableau.

## Data Sources

- 'Proyecto NTL' (https://github.com/dgomezlechon/Projecto-NTL.git)


- Morningstar ("AAPL Key Ratios.xls")

## Visualization Structure

In this visualization project I have created a story composed of three Dashboards. In first place I focus on price, showing the historical price evolution as well as a candle chart where we can filter the date range and focus on the performance of the stock in each of the days. I have also included some key metrics as a summary of the company performance. 

In the second dashboard I have focused on Apples results, focusing on the companies fundamentals and their evolution throughout the years. The main focuses have been earnings, margins and profitability ratios.

Finaly on the last dashboard is aimed at explaining big fluctuations in price by showing price movements and directly opening the news related to the stock on that particular date. I have also included infomation on stock dividends throughout time.
